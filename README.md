# OneStopOneShot
This is my capstone project for PDX Code Guild Full Stack Bootcamp.

## Introduction
    TTRPGs have been increasing in popularity in recent years. At the crest of this wave is D&D 5e. Although there are countless resources for DMs to build sessions, they are scattered about the internet in various aggregators. One of the main problems that DMs encounter is scheduling, and what to do if players cancel last minute. 

    I built this tool as a proof of concept for something to address this problem; this tool integrates several other tools to allow a DM to quickly and efficiently create a portfolio for single session play. All monster resources are sourced from the DM Basic Rules provided by Wizards of the Coast.

## Functionality
- Generator for antagonist/villain, patron, and setting
- Generator for encounters
- Generator for maps

### Villain generator
    The antagonist/villain generator creates a profile including their background, motives, personality, flaws, etc.
    The generator will also create a patron to explain why the players are bothering with this dungeon in the first place.

### Encounter generator
    The encounter generator is a dumbed down version of Kobold Plus Fight Club. It allows the user to create and save parties, display EXP goals, and add monsters to encounters based on those goals.

### Map generator
    As of now, the map generator pulls from a simple roguelike api. In the future, it will be more robust.
